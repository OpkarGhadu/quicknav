### How To

1. Go to the menu bar and click the QuickNav icon, then select 'Options.'
2. On the shortcuts page, you can add keyboard shortcuts, names, and URLs. For example, 'y, YouTube, youtube.com'. When the QuickNav menu is open, pressing the 'y' key will take you to 'youtube.com'. Ensure each shortcut is unique.
3. On the customize page, you can add an image/gif or text/ASCII art. You can also change the background, text, and secondary colors, as well as the username shown in the QuickNav menu. Currently, the shortcut cannot be changed from 'Alt+Z'. Be sure to press the save button.
4. Close the options page and press 'Alt+Z' (or your custom shortcut) to open the QuickNav menu. Note that certain pages, like the default new tab page, do not support the menu. You may need to refresh the page after saving for the changes to take effect.

### Note on Browsers

This extension is designed with cross-browser support in mind. The code is compatible across browsers, except for the manifest files, which are located in the `/browsers` directory.
